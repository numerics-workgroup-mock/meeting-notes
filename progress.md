This document's style is somewhat influenced by `Foundation`'s ["Implementation Status"](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/main/Docs/Status.md) and `Tokamak`'s ["Progress"](https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak/blob/main/docs/progress.md).

The progress tracked here are the top-level tasks' general progress.

As this document gets populated, we can divide tasks into categories.
