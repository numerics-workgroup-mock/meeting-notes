- New member from Passive Logic joined meeting
  - Exploratory discussion ensued answering the question “What applications do individuals want to build” (e.g. iPhone, Data Science server side).
  - Work group unified on previously expressed commitment towards building a NumPyish library in Swift; building out a foundation to grow from.
- Smaller group this time, will follow up on Slack for more detailed coordination for other members.
  - This impacted decision making about Matrix API design, ops, and backend(s).
- Previous question about what our organization name should be: Decision to consider this the de facto work group and name it as such.

Follow up

- Next meeting in 2 weeks - 6/25 9am PT
- Start GitHub organization with work group name
- Continue research on existing libraries which were posted in [Slack](https://swiftnumericswg.slack.com/archives/C03HVQXRS0P/p1654365492481819)
