- Project Management
- Cadance and expectations for next meeting

## Expectations for next meeting 6/11
Do some reading related to operators which Philip will post in the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/swiftnumericswg/shared_invite/zt-1aj264hmo-UW8Z0UKktKonC7tetMw9UQ)

## Meta
- Is numerics a part of this?
  - Yes, it fits the foundation of ML.
  - It fits in the more general differential programming perspective.
- Initiatives should further end goal of scientists using an alternative to Python (i.e. Swift).
- We should work on what the community wants, not necessarily on what one individual wants.
- Very important that we break down work and make progress, we can’t lose the momentum.
- Process:
  - Not everyone will always be able to attend every meeting, so need to establish strong communication channels
    - Slack, Swift forums
  - Need place to keep track progress
    - GitHub Repo
    - Could model ourselves after other groups e.g. String processing group

## Communication/Project management ideas
- A weekly or monthly blog where we explore a new subfield of Numerics and try using it from Swift
- List various end goals, and projects/sub projects to get there.
- People can contribute to the projects/sub projects which they are interested in.
- We review the list of projects on a regular basis and when someone needs help for a sub projects, they can « pitch » for help on that project/sub project
- Learning from each other
  - E.g. learn how to use swift colab
  - Philip adds Docker support to Swift-Colab instead of making dedicated repo for Swift scripting

## Brainstorming:

Priority:
- 1: High
- 2: Medium
- 3: Low
Smallest average number wins

Winner is Matrices / Numpy-like library

## Autodiff
Priority = 2 1 3 2 1 2 = 11 / 6 = 1.83
- High level stuff in differentiation working e.g. std lib
- 2 separate parts
  - Low level parts that does the pullback
  - High level parts in std lib
    - Anyone with enough experience in Swift can help with stdlib pieces
- Autodiff as an end goal

## Matrices / Numpy-like library
Priority = 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 = 9 / 6 = 1.5
- Matrix abstractions are not there
- Make a Swift alternative to NumPy, because previously S4TF was the only libraries with matrix operations and its Linear Algebra module had a very small scope +1
- Push of matrix calculations - may in the meantime depend on blast
- Dependent typing - such as for matrix calculations
- N dimensional matrix - swift generics manifesto originally had the ability to extend for example square matrices in the case where that only made sense
  - No efficient data structures exist at this point to implement e.g. PCA

## Numerics
Priority = 3 2 3 3 1 3 = 15 / 6 = 2.5
- Transition from real numbers to complex numbers
- Uniform foundation to work with numbered types
  - E.g. to create big int or float 128
- Emulating higher-precision computations with smaller numbers (e.g. using two Float64’s to emulate a Float128) - like how you emulate double precision on a GPU
- Sacrificing precision for dynamic range
- Push for computing intrinsics to be exposed so it can be elevated to std lib

## Scripting / Dev Experience
Priority = 3 2 3 3 = 11 / 4 = 2.75
- Langs that are used for numerics/data are really good at scripting
  - Swift can’t import what’s on the system to import in swift
  - This would in general make swift more attractive
- Make a repo to help people with scripting (tutorials), or a command-line application for linking a Swift package into a Swift script
